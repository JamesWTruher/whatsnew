# Get-WhatsNew

[Get-WhatsNew](https://github.com/PowerShell/WhatsNew) is a cmdlet that provides information about
changes and new features for a version of PowerShell, delivered to the local terminal experience.

## Motivation

Customers are unaware of benefits, new features and changes, that could impact their automation,
performance and security. Today, this useful information is provided through
[Microsoft Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/scripting/whats-new/what-s-new-in-powershell-70)
and the PowerShell GitHub repository. PowerShell customers would benefit from being able to get this
information in the terminal as they expect.

- Customers expect to learn about available features that may enable new solutions
- Customers expect version specific information available from within PowerShell to make upgrade
  decisions.

> so that I can discover and implement new features in managing my products.

> As a developer,
